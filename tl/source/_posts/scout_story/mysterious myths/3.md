{% bubble Rei %}
……Yes, I already got the hang of the plan. Looks like Saegusa-kun prepared sufficiently in advance.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Ibara %}
Then afterwards, amongst your hundred duties, please do contemplate my suggestion! If you can help bring about this particular plan, I believe our companies would definitely accomplish the strongest fronts of cooperation!

If you have any further questions, regardless of how many, I, Saegusa Ibara, will be willing to explain one by one, until you fully understand♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rei %}
Actually, I indeed still have a question. Do tell where Nagisa-kun is, I have something I want to consult him with.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Ibara %}
……Oya oya? Now that’s an unexpected question.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rei %}
No, thou art mistaken. The reason I am looking for Ran-kun is not to discuss job matters, it is because this matter requires that of Nagisa-kun’s judgement.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Ibara %}
……?

Perhaps you may have heard that, in fact, His Excellency has already handed over all the “unit” related work for me to take care of. That is why if you have any questions regarding this facet of-
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Ibara %}
So you wish for this fossil-like piece of stone picked up on the roadside to undergo an appraisal… So that’s what it was.

His excellency is enthusiastic about matters of archaeology; I believe he would also be really happy that you seeked him for help with this small matter.

But then, according to the allotted schedule, His Excellency should be practising acting in the practice room. The “Dramatica” theatre troupe is organising a performance soon, and His Excellency seems to be quite absorbed in it.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rei %}
Oh…… It so happens that I really want to experience a bit of Ran-kun's acting expertise as well. Then I shall ask Saegusa-kun to lead the way♪

{% bubble Nagisa %}
“Ahh, the foolish and weak human race! Unable to see clearly your fate, thy biggest lamentation!

Thee naïvely assume, beheading the I who is deemed evil, and in one fell swoop, becoming the saviour? As thee knows, you will soon fall into the ending stage of mine!

No one would mourn the fresh blood spilled from thee’s desperate struggle. No one would feel grateful for thee previous accomplishments. Only the blind who seek fame and accolades, dance upon thee’s grave in vain.

If it is so, the brave! Should thee raise up thy sharp blade too, and pierce my heart?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa %}
Nagisa: ……Then this scene ends here.

……Plays are for people to see, if not,  then it cannot be called a play.

……Therefore, the audience of two hiding behind the door. Since you finished watching, I hope you will give me some constructive criticism.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Ibara %}
Ahaha! As expected of His Excellency, my ambush skills in front of your sharp senses are reduced to nothing.

But I was only following Sakuma-shi’s wishes by waiting a bit so as to not disturb His Excellency’s brilliant performance. I did not intend to play a childish game of hide-and-seek with you, Your Excellency!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rei %}
That’s right, that’s right. I was not planning on hiding in the dark corner to peep, but was entranced by Nagisa-kun's acting as the evil dragon; even until now, my heart is pounding non-stop.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Ibara %}
Hm hm hm. If you must know, His Excellency’s flexibility would never be achieved by the common man, no matter what type of character is given to him, he would bring it to life.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa %}
……Then this scene ends.

……If it is really as you say, then this performance by the troupe shouldn’t make fans disappointed.
{% endbubble %}


{% bubble Rei %}
“Dragon slayers will eventually become evil dragons”, was it…… I think that Tenshouin-kun would like this fable.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa %}
……Yes indeed. Eichi-kun would have fun taking the role of the evil dragon. Even though we have previously taken charge of a role like a dragon slayer, it is a so-called “upright” character.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa %}
……But then, now, we don’t need evil dragons or dragon slayers to arbitrarily make a sacrifice.

……Like recycling a malignant curse, in Yumenosaki Academy, it comes to an end.

……Upon that slowly closing wound of a place, being able to showcase a smile is possible…  a flower unfurls again.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rei %}
Looks like thou hast a feel for this play. If I ever have the chance to, I will go see your stage, Nagisa-kun.

To personally watch the stage Ran-kun and Hibiki-kun are both on would definitely give me twice as many shivers.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa %}
……Haha. Under the ruling of the gods, there may be a day like that.

……As it seems that you have an interest in theatre, Sakuma-kun, do you want to participate in our troupe activities as well?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rei %}
Kekeke. Thank thee for your kindness, but I think I’ll pass. Wanting to do it and being able to do it are, in fact, two separate things.

In the daylight I have difficulty displaying my full potential. I can only manage situations where my energy level is low with great difficulty, and I only suit the opposite time. [^1] For this activity I already underwent sufficient training.

And what’s more, I do not have my “vampire grandpa” as well, so there’s a limit to the role types I can act out.

For example, if a cleric or excitable children were to request a performance, it would completely break the mould and create nothing but conflict.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa %}
……Yes. Regarding that point… I understand completely

…………Maintaining your persona is indeed a rather difficult problem. Ibara usually is in charge of rectifying my public image.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Ibara %}
Please forgive me for not following along to the two of you’s conversation, but then did His Excellency mention my name just now?

Thank you for remembering me, and at any rate, I was beginning to wonder whether I really exist in this situation!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa %}
……Ibara, are you thinking of reminding me to go and eat lunch with Eden? But I’m not that hungry now.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Ibara %}
Oh, regretfully enough, it’s too early for lunch. Actually, Sakuma-shi has something to ask you to overlook, that’s why I helped to find you, that’s all.

Please inform me in advance what dishes you want to eat in the afternoon, and I will consider how to efficiently coordinate its nutritional balance and arrange it accordingly!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa %}
……I said I’m not hungry just now. Just go by your preferences, Ibara.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Ibara %}
Yes! As you command, Your Excellency!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rei %}
(……Although I heard that Ran-kun’s daily meals are all regulated by Saegusa-kun, I didn’t think it would be as such.)

Nagisa-kun. My coming is to represent Adonis-kun and little miss Anzu’s request, hoping that thou art able to pass judgement over the rock that they found in the hanging garden.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa %}
……Good. I will look at it closely.

……I am also expectant, the treasure that the two of them found, exactly what its value is.
