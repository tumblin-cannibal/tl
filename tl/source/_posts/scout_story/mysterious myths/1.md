♪～♪～♪

(Hmm. The decision to have morning practice here was correct.)

(The air here has the fragrance of flowers and dew. When I hear the birds’ sweet voices, my spirit naturally calms down, letting me get into the mood faster.)

(Even though I still want to continue singing practice, it's going to be time for breakfast soon. Then, there will be a lot of people who would come here.)

(Even if my voice is pleasant to hear, if by chance I disturb someone’s peace, then I would just become a nuisance to them.)

(Speaking of breakfast, I’m starting to get hungry. And I need to recharge my energy.)

(If I go to the canteen now, there should be many free tables.)

(Hm? Who tapped my shoulder?)

……Oh, it’s Anzu. Good morning.

It seems that you already called me several times, but I seemed to have not heard you?

Speaking about which, just now I feel as if I heard a faraway voice, but because I was thinking about other stuff, I didn’t pay attention. I apologize for not recognising your voice instantly. Why were you looking for me, Anzu?

You say it isn’t work-related, but that you spotted me on the way to the staff canteen and wanted to ask if I’d like to eat breakfast together?

Haha, of course. After all, I very rarely see you at school, let alone eating a meal together. Let’s talk while going to the canteen.

I don't know what today’s set meal will be. If it’s just the usual offering between A and B, the two types of set meal, I’ll just select the meal with more meat.

You want to select the meal with more vegetables? Even though you’re publicly known as the “hardworking producer”……
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Adonis %}
In my opinion, your body is thin and delicate as always, just like a piece of paper. I’m worried for your health.

If you ate more meat, your body would become stronger. This way you can grab hold of a healthy spirit.

Did I say something wrong just now and made you upset? I’m sorry, ……?! (Anzu suddenly grabbed ahold of Adonis’ shoulder)

Wha- What is it? Don’t tell me that there’s something dangerous around here?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Adonis %}
I didn’t even notice anything at all. It looks like I wasn’t mindful enough.

But then, can you please not hold me so tightly? If I am stopped here, unable to move, I would have no way to protect you.

You told me to stand still here, then lowered your head to look at my left foot?

Ahh, so it’s like this. You’re interested in that.

Let me pick it up for you.

The shape of this piece of rock is really special, huh. Upon a closer look, there is something mysterious that defies all logic lodged into the rock.

……Hm, just like you said, it really does look like a bone. According to the books I read, this type of stone is probably a “fossil” from a long, long time ago isn’t it?

I wasn’t paying attention to my path just now, and so I nearly stepped on it. If I had stepped on it and broken it, i’d definitely regret it for the rest of my life.

Thank goodness you stopped me, Anzu. Actually, your strength is greater than I imagined. To thank you, let me treat you to a meal later.

Speaking of, how should we deal with this stone? If we put it back, it’s very likely to be stepped on by other people.

We could possibly keep it for ourselves. But if it really is a piece of fossil, shouldn’t we give it to a museum or something of the like, since it has value?

But, since it was Anzu who found it, I’ll leave it to you to decide.

No matter what you choose, I’ll always support you.

{% bubble Rei %}
Oh? If it isn’t Adonis-kun and the little miss. What are thou standing there idly for?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Adonis %}
Good morning, Sakuma-senpai.

……I can’t get used to the sight of senpai so early in the morning.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rei %}
Huaa (yawning noises)…… In actuality, I too am not completely used to getting up early.

During breakfast, I, in a daze, squeezed an entire bag of ketchup into my coffee.

All thanks to that mishap, which led to the weird taste, upon which I was awakened. So what are you up to standing about here?

If you don’t head to the canteen soon, the number of people there will multiply.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Adonis %}
Actually we’ve come across a conundrum. If senpai is free to hear us out, I would like to hear your opinion.
