{% bubble Rei %}
Oh, turns out you picked up a rock resembling a “fossil” ... Let me get a closer look.

…………

{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Adonis %}
…………

Sakuma-senpai, what is it? Don’t you think it’s a fossil?

……Or is our guess wrong, and this is only a piece of rock?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rei %}
Hmm…… Kindly forgive me for being unable to make an immediate judgment.

Even though I am an aged monster, and can recognise more things than the average person, I cannot know about every field of knowledge.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Adonis %}
Fossil experts…… I remember COSPRO’s Ran-senpai is experienced in this field, and has a handful of fossils too.

The other day Ran-senpai gifted me a type of jewel called a “topaz”. I still don’t know its use.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rei %}
Wu~ Wuwuwu (Crying noise)……In the time when I wasn't paying attention, Adonis-kun and Ran-kun became so close so as to exchange gifts? I am terribly lonesome.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Adonis %}
Hm? Previously, I helped Ran-senpai find a piece of lapis lazuli that was thrown away and received it as thanks.[^1]

According to Sakuma-senpai, is that the mark of a close relationship?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rei %}
Heh heh heh. Is it not? Looks like Adonis-kun is still a late-bloomer♪

If it is so, let thee go and find Nagisa-kun to examine this rock, and you would most likely find a more astute evaluation.

Even if it’s accidental, miscalculating the true value of this would be a hindrance. Let I recommend thee to search for a fossil expert to appraise it.

The I just now was just joking. If thou are able to make more friends, I’ll be happy for you in my heart.

{% bubble Hinata %}
Good morning, Sakuma-senpai!

If not for the waking-up service by me and Yuta-kun’s, it’d be hard for senpai to get up on time~! Wave☆ (Salute)
{% endbubble %}

{% img https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/852910018466283553/919427073767010304/IMG_9286.png %}


{% bubble Yuta %}
Yes yes, surprisingly Sakuma-senpai didn’t laze around in bed today, how wonderful♪ Wave☆（Salute）
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rei %}
……Woah?! Oh, it's the kids from “2wink”.

I’ll treat what you all said just now as a compliment. Even though it is the truth that I’m frequently unable to get up in the mornings, I hope you all will still let me save some face, and not go about announcing it.

But then, if the I remembers correctly, what you all did is according to Saegusa-kun’s instructions isn’t it?

I almost thought that I had been hallucinating, two Saegusa-kuns had appeared before my eyes.

Or is it that I assumed such a lowly snake-like existence, has advanced to a stage where he is capable of performing shadow arts?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuta %}
Ahaha. Although the vice prez may be so interesting that it’s actually a little scary… aren’t those kinds of shadow arts only something a ninja like Shinobu-kun could do?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hinata %}
But this brings up the point that the two of us imitate vice-prez so well that we’re indistinguishable, right?

Yup! Looks like we really are the best two-in-one twin idols! Right, Yuta-kun……☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuta %}
Uwoah, don’t hug me in front of Sakuma-senpai, aniki~!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rei %}
Kukuku. Looking at the sight of cute kids playing about, I can’t help but reminisce upon the happy times in the light music club……♪

Thy rapid growth is all recorded in my brain.  But for the time being let I, as your senpai, give some advice.

Mirroring each other is indeed a type of technique. But if you’re pursuing similarity and not cherishing your sense of self, eventually you can only become the second “other”, and not the one and only “ego”.

Even though it just could be me being a busybody.  If thou really likes it, you could ask Hibiki-kun to teach you the tricks of the trade.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuta %}
Hm, I completely get what you’re saying, Sakuma-senpai. But when we first decided on this mirror act, it wasn’t to give up on our ego right?

In contrast, this is all so we can keep going on our own in COSPRO. A type of survival tactic.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hinata %}
It’s just like what Yuta-kun said: to exist without any bumps in the road, we’re gonna employ all our skills and use every resource necessary!

We’re more determined than senpai thinks, that’s why you don’t have to worry. Of course, when it’s needed, we’ll also ask for help from you whenever♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rei %}
Hmm. Then I’ll be completely relieved. Talking about that, did you happen to see Saegusa-kun in the office?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hinata %}
Ah~ Right right, we’re pinning everything on this, which vice-prez also instigated.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuta %}
Vice-prez is currently taking care of a problem that demands his personal attention. So if Sakuma-senpai arrived before the allotted time, we’d have to be in charge of welcoming you.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rei %}
……So it is such. How Saegusa-kun treats his guests is rather attentive.
{% endbubble %}

{% img https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/852910018466283553/919427089466286151/IMG_9287.png %}

{% bubble Ibara %}
Good morning, Sakuma-san! For all that trouble of stooping down and coming all the way here without even a welcome… I sincerely apologize for that!

As you’ve heard, because of being tangled up in prior engagements I was unable to personally welcome you. And wasted a few minutes of your precious time, so please allow me to direct my most sincere apologies to you!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rei %}
Saegusa-kun has no need to apologize. This time it is thanks to you, that I could happily converse with the precious children I haven’t seen in a long while.
{% endbubble %}

{% img https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/852910018466283553/919427089814401044/IMG_9288.png %}

{% bubble Rei %}
Thus I, on the contrary, should be thanking Saegusa-kun for creating such an opportunity for us. Wave……☆（Salute）
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Ibara %}
……?!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hinata %}
(Whispering) Ahaha♪ Are you seeing this, how vice-prez is standing there in a daze~?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuta %}
(Whispering) Ahh, looks like Sakuma-senpai’s imitation dealt severe psychic damage.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Ibara %}
……Keke. Showing you such an uncomposed visage is too impolite of me, please do forget that ever happened.

However, I didn’t think that this salute would be so popular with everyone! It’s a great honour and it fills me with profound respect and humility!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rei %}
Kekeke. Previously when I first saw “2wink”’s greeting, I assumed that this was protocol peculiar to COSPRO, and therefore tried it out.

Since we’re already off-schedule, let us cut to the chase.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Ibara %}
As you wish♪ Next time I shall proceed to use the most efficient strategy to introduce the current collaboration plan in the most efficient way. If you have any questions, feel free to interrupt me unceremoniously or any way you please!
{% endbubble %}
