{% bubble Hiyori %}
♪～♪～

Stepping barefoot on the soft sand feels great! Coupled with the refreshing sea breeze, it’s such good weather/ii hiyori……♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun %}
Haha, Ohii-san looks like a little child running amok. Be careful to not step on crabs and whatnot~?

……Wah!? Why’d you splash water at me!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori %}
Hmph. Since Jun-kun says I’m a little child then playing like this is normal isn’t it?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun %}
GODDAMN…… Take a hint, Ohii-san!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori %}
I’m hiding~ Yuzuru-kun, careful☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuzuru %}
............?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun %}
Ah?! Crap, I already splashed the water at-!

So- Sorry, I didn’t mean to splash it on you, Fushimi.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuzuru %}
Ah, it’s alright, only the corner of my T-shirt got wet, please don’t mind it.

Actually it was me who was distracted, if not this would have been easily avoided.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori %}
So it’s like that Yuzuru-kun, does looking at such beautiful scenery lift your spirits？
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuzuru %}
Yes indeed, I noticed there are booths that are selling the fresh local produce too. As expected of a holiday resort, how plentiful♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori %}
Hm? Yuzuru-kun’s observation skills are particularly exceptional.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuzuru %}
I was thinking that, in such hot weather, body moisture would quickly evaporate. Young master would definitely feel thirsty after work.

That’s why if your esteemed selves wouldn’t mind, please allow me to go to the booths and pick out ingredients to prepare some drinks and salad.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori %}
……You want to take charge even here? Why not go to the cold drinks stall and buy ready-made drinks?

Just in good time, I happen to be thirsty now so why don't we let Jun-kun buy it for us?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun %}
Hah~? Can’t you see the long queue of people in front of the cold drinks stall? By the time my turn comes, I’ll practically be sunburnt all over?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuzuru %}
Please don’t fret over this. Even if the need arises to run around, leave it to me to wait on your esteemed selves.

But in just a glance, one can tell that those types of drinks add a lot of artificial colouring and flavours, and even if the young master may like it, it doesn’t have enough nutritional value.

Besides, I also feel that it is within my powers to create a handmade gift to thank the young master for his hard work.

At this very moment, this is what I want to do the most.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori %}
Hmm…… If Yuzuru-kun is happy to do so, then I don’t have anything to say. But if you do that, we can’t call it a good rest, right?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuzuru %}
It’s nothing. If you actually let me rest and not do anything else, the accumulated stress would be far too much.

Hiyori：Ahaha, it sounds like Yuzuru-kun has some kind of strange inclinations♪

Then all the best to you, if you have anything you want, let Jun-kun help out! See you later~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun %}
Hey hey, don’t go running around…… If you get lost, I won’t be responsible for finding you~?
{% endbubble %}

{% note narration %}
A few minutes later

{% bubble Jun %}
Fushimi, I brought the fruit stall’s juicer.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuzuru %}
Ahh… This would really help a lot, thank you so much.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun %}
No no, it’s only a simple gesture, rather you shouldn’t treat me so courteously.

What’s more, because Ohii-san brought so much luggage I troubled you to help hold a part of it, so let this be in return for your kindness.

If you have anything else I could do, just ask.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuzuru %}
Haha. If you let someone like me, who is used to waiting on others, suddenly instruct, won’t it feel sort of strange.

But considering that, could you please help rinse the fruits and vegetables over here, and leave the rest to me.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun %}
For sure, no problem~

(Ahh, is this the true ability of the Himemiya house’s butler?)

(His knife work is way too skilled, and he’s swiftly cutting the fruit into small pieces so quick that it‘s difficult for the bare eye to keep up! I have to make the best use of the time to wash up! )
{% endbubble %}

{% note narration %}
After a period of time

{% bubble Tori %}
Huu…… Today’s work finally came to a close, and it went relatively well! Everyone, you have worked really hard~ (bows cutely)

(Huhu, now I’m hot and tired and thirsty, how I’d like to comfortably lie down in bed and have a cup of shaved ice.)

(First things first, I should go meet Yuzuru and the others…… )

(Ah, they're walking over just in time. Yuzuru seems to be holding something……?  )
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuzuru %}
Young Master, you’ve worked hard today♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori %}
——Woah?!

That- What is that, the colour is so weird~!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuzuru %}
Please calm down, this is not some weird object. This is the nutritional drink I created to congratulate young master with a feast, please try it out♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori %}
……Even if you look at me with that gaze full of anticipation, I still don’t want to drink it! This totally looks like something you can’t even digest!
{% endbubble %}

{% img https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/852910018466283553/910376980984258580/IMG_8205.png %}

{% bubble Hiyori %}
Hmm…… You can’t blame Tori-kun, I also feel that this drink is not at all 「Pretty」.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun %}
Oh, Ohii-san has returned. You’ve got a good grasp on time.

Just now you obviously didn’t help at all, so you can’t pick on someone else’s hardwork, can you?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori %}
Ahh, this is a misunderstanding as large as the heavens. I wasn’t slacking off, I went to get a present for Tori-kun!

Look here, these are the pink shells and sea snails I worked hard to find on the beach, don’t they fit Tori-kun?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori %}
Woah~! Each one of them is so cute! Thank you Hiyori-sama, I’ll keep it well♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori %}
Hmmhmm, good boy good boy♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuzuru %}
……One can see that I arrived first to give the young master a gift, so why……
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori %}
Ahaha, must we be particular about who comes first for this too?

But then Tori-kun, I think that you shouldn’t neglect the effort of Servant-kun. He must have spent quite a lot of thought for this glass.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori %}
I- I definitely know that! After all, Yuzuru could never want to harm me, right? Despite my worry, let me drink it!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuzuru %}
Ahh, young master, thank you for the trust you have put in me……!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori %}
Eh, why are you thanking me! Isn’t this supposed to be the other way around?

(Anyways, it’s only a drink, I just need to hold my breath and drink it in one gulp!

Gulp gulp……
{% endbubble %}

{% img https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/852910018466283553/910376981227536425/IMG_8206.png %}

{% bubble Tori %}
——? That’s weird, the taste is unlike what I thought it to be, it’s actually pretty nice?

Yuzuru, give me one more glass~!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuzuru %}
Yes, it’s a delight to see young master enjoying it♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori %}
Eh, is it that good? Then I would like to try and see!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun %}
Hmm, when drinking it, it is both sweet and refreshing. Actually, when I was looking at Yuzuru’s exquisite creation from the sidelines, I just knew that the taste would be pretty good.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuzuru %}
Haha, you exaggerate. Actually during 「Niki’s Kitchen」I requested that Shiina-sama teach me a few ways to blend drinks and it seems like it turned out well, though I must tweak its appearance a little.

In order for young master would be happier eating my handmade nutritional meals, I must continue working harder to improve my cooking skills.
