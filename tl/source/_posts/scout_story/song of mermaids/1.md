(Hmm hmm~ Hmm♪ At long last I’m able to browse the idol merch store~!)

(With the wall fully covered by idols’ pictures and flyers, and the songs of different groups entering your ears…… It feels like I’m surrounded by my favourite idols, it’s so Love-ly☆)

(For the me that had a super exhausting day at practice, this is basically the best feast to regain energy♪)

(Let me think, what should I buy today…… I didn’t get that badge last time, should I go and pick it out again?)

(Even though I brought enough money to buy a whole box this time, but to gather a whole lot of dupes just for one, it feels like it isn’t worth it.)

(Not to mention if I happen to get the badge after just buying one pack, then I’ll have quite some money remaining for other merch.)

(The shop's marketing tactics definitely appeal to the consumer’s gambling mentality. Huhu, what a trap~……)

(Wait a sec, that 「Eden」poster over there, it seems like it’s my first time seeing it…… Could it be newly arrived merch?)

(Then I better hurry. After all, 「Eden」merch always sells super fast, that even if you go online to buy it second-hand, the prices always skyrocket.)

(…… Oh, I remember! A few days ago during a tea party for a 「Pretty5」meeting, Tomoe-senpai seemed to have mentioned「Eden」would be releasing a new CD soon.)

(Turns out this time they would have a live handshake event for fans who bought the CD…… If I miss this rare chance, I’ll definitely regret it forever!)

(Ahaha, it seems even the employees are shocked at the amount of CDs I’m buying, and kindly layered the shopping bags too.)

(Huu(groaning), this month’s allowance is going to vanish in the blink of an eye, I told myself that I’ll have to save money on food and expenses a bit……)

(Having so many CDs, at least it’ll buy me some time during the handshake event, won’t it? I’m really looking forward to what Tomoe-senpai will say, ehehehe……♪)

Jun-kun, you walk too slowly! If you don’t want to be left behind, hurry up and come!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Aira %}
(……Huh? Just now I seemed to have really heard Tomoe-senpai’s voice? Or am I still deep inside the world of fantasy?)

{% bubble Jun %}
GODDAMN! Isn’t it because Ohii-san tossed all your messy bags to me to carry, on the other hand you’re free to roam?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori %}
Haha, hasn’t that always been Jun-kun’s job? It's too late to feel dissatisfied now!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Aira %}
(Let me pinch myself…… Uwoah, it hurts!)

(Wait what, this really is the real world and in front of me are living 3D idols?! Wahhhh, my mind is going blank!)

(——Ah, the two senpai-s went towards the escalator. I better hurry up and catch up, and tread lightly……☆)

(Even though sneaking behind the senpai-s’ back comes off as quite rude, i have to ignore that for now!)

(Being able to see 「Eve」, the two elite idols’ everyday shopping, it really is too Love~ly! I might miss it if I blink!)

(That's why, please allow me to enjoy this sacred sight for a bit, to create an unforgettable memory……)
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori %}
Hmm, this clothing store looks fine! Jun-kun don't just sit there slacking off, hurry and accompany me~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun %}
What is it, can’t you let me rest for a bit…… Unlike Ohii-san, I’m not fatigue-less during shopping.

When we left home didn’t we say today is only for buying sunscreen products? Clothing shops are undeniably not according to plan.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori %}
I’ve already said change of plans, haven’t I? If life only moves forward while following a prescribed path, that’d be way too boring.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun %}
That sentence shouldn’t be used here…… Well never mind, Ohii-san always goes way off-schedule, and I'll only be able to follow you to the end.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori %}
Mmhmmh! Having spent days working with Jun-kun, I can finally welcome the rare days of rest, looking forward to it all from now on♪

Talking about summer, we’ll surely need to go to the beach and fully embrace the radiant sunshine and soft sandy beach! So I definitely need to restock my sunscreen and summer outfits!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun %}
……Just asking, but what’s the necessary cause and effect between those two sentences?

Oh and also, since we entered this shop, it seems like there’s this fiery gaze that is pinned to our backs…… I can’t be wrong, right?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori %}
Hmmhmm, my existence is someone who always catches the eye, that’s why this is inevitable!

Since Jun-kun is always by my side, surely you’ve gotten used to it by now?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun %}
Sigh~ Is it alright to be so relaxed? Or is it that Ohii-san feels that even if we run into any suspicious person, I’ll be your shield?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori %}
That idea isn’t so bad, thank you for reminding me☆

To put it simply, don’t mind it, and focus instead on enjoying the process of shopping, that’s good weather/ii-hiyori!!

Come look come look, this t-shirt with a pattern of big red flowers, doesn’t it have the spirit of summer? ♪

But I fancy the coconut tree pattern mor-

(……Hm? There’s another hand that’s faster than me by a second, grabbing a shirt of the same style?)
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Aira %}
Hey excuse me, could I pay~♪

(But the merch I’ve already bought is so heavy to carry, even if I wanted to buy more, I’d most likely struggle to bring it back.)
