{% bubble Yuzuru %}
……Ah, greetings, Hiyori-sama. To think we meet here.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori %}
Oh? If it isn’t the Himemiya family’s Servant-kun; Yuzuru-kun. Looks like your limbs are still pretty nimble, you almost scared me.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuzuru %}
Haha, thank you for the compliment. I was hurrying to fulfill the young master’s orders, so I didn't notice you. My deepest apologies.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori %}
No, on the contrary, I'm not complimenting you at all. You are the same person as always, only knowing how to be around your master for the whole day.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori %}
Yuzuru, are you still not done yet?

……Wah, it’s Hiyori-sama.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori %}
Long time no see, Tori-kun! If I had known you’ll also be shopping today, I would have come together with you!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori %}
Ehehe. Is Hiyori-sama inviting me on a date? I’m so happy♪
{% endbubble %}


{% bubble Hiyori %}
Beachwear? Is Tori-kun also preparing to go to the beach? Do you want to go together with Jun-kun and I?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori %}
Ahaha…… Even though I want to agree, unfortunately that isn’t it……
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuzuru %}
Yes. This time the young master is going to have a summer beach-themed personal photoshoot, and the site is a famous resort.

The start of the shoot is this weekend, and I will be following, that is why today I accompanied the young master to buy preparatory items.

Speaking of which, last year the young master had an advertisement job as the face of a soft drink manufacturer  company and it was received enthusiastically. That’s why these types of jobs keep arriving, one after the other.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori %}
Yes yes, I remember! The smile of Tori-kun blossoming towards the camera honestly has the power to make one’s heart flutter a beat.

Jun-kun and I will also be heading towards that beach during the weekend, so our travel plans will luckily overlap! Maybe we can even meet by the beach?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori %}
Ok ok! With Hiyori-sama by my side, I’ll become more motivated too☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori %}
Then it’s set♪ But there’s still one more problem right in front of us (gestures at the the clothes)
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori %}
……Eh? I got too distracted by Hiyori-sama’s exciting offer, but it seems like Hiyori-sama also likes this shirt?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori %}
After all, Tori-kun and I both like cute and trendy things, to have such a coincidence is not as if it’s unexplainable.

Thinking of it, if you were walking on the beach and suddenly got welcomed by a person dressed exactly like you…… Tori-kun wouldn’t feel happy, right?

But, if it’s Hiyori-sama, I wouldn't mind? That kind of scene would show that our relationship is very close♪

Ahh, then are you saying you want to wear a father-son outfit? Even more than me, would saying Tori-kun and Yuzuru wearing the same outfit be better?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori %}
No no, I don't want to match outfits with Yuzuru!?

But I believe, as idols, to put all our efforts into standing out would be best.

Hmm…… It would feel a little awkward.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori %}
Haha, I’m kidding♪ Although it’s only natural for a dazzling person like me to have gained Tori-kun’s admiration.
{% endbubble %}

{% img https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/852910018466283553/908942921787666452/IMG_7816.png %}

{% bubble Hiyori %}
Even if we are all members of 「Pretty5」, your 「Pretty」and my 「Pretty」are not the same, right?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori %}
……Hm, I understand what Hiyori-sama means.

If it’s like that, who would suit this shirt more?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori %}
That’s of course the world’s most beautiful, most handsome and cutest ever idol—me!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun %}
I feel that Ohii-san can add two more “most”, the world’s most narcissistic, most capricious idol……♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori %}
Hmph, does this conversation have any room for Jun-kun to butt in?

Besides, Hiyori-sama already reserved all of the “most”s, so don’t you mind giving me just this?

Really sorry but my principle is to hold on tight to my favourite things!

If Tori-kun wants it, then you’ll just have to try and snatch it away from me~☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori %}
Ahaha♪ Because Hiyori-sama is a person I respect, I’m fine with all the other titles being carried by you, but having the title of ‘cutest ever idol’ isn’t quite right?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori %}
Eh~ There’s no need for stealing, because the world’s cutest idol has always been me☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun %}
Wait wait, it’s obviously only picking clothes, how come it turned into a cuteness competition……?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori %}
Hmm hmm, cuteness competition sounds good! Why don’t we have a live vote! Hiyori VS Tori-kun☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun %}
Ohii-san,  do you think I am the tsukkomi?

But I know Ohii-san has a lot of clothes that are immediately tossed into the closet without seeing much use, isn’t that a big waste of materials? That's why giving up on this one wouldn’t hurt.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori %}
Ugh, how can Jun-kun stab me in the back at the pivotal moment! I'm so hurt!

I don't have much aesthetic sensibility regarding「Pretty」, that’s why for me either choice doesn’t make a difference……
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori %}
Wow, does it mean your vote is for me? Of course Yuzuru would be on my side, so victory is already secured—
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuzuru %}
Actually, I believe that this shirt would not perfectly showcase the young master’s cuteness……

Hm, please forgive me for I cannot express these feelings clearly.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori %}
……Huh?! Why didn’t you say anything earlier, and even helped pick out that shirt to try on?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuzuru %}
In the end, this is my personal opinion, which shouldn’t affect the young master’s decision.

What’s more, to satisfy a master’s wishes at all times is when a butler becomes complete……♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori %}
Haha, looks like Tori-kun and I are at a stalemate, we need to find one more vote to decide this!
{% endbubble %}

{% img https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/852910018466283553/908942932843831356/IMG_7817.png %}

{% bubble Hiyori %}
Hey, Aira-kun~ Come here quickly, I can see you♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori %}
……? Did Hiyori-sama say Shiratori’s name? He’s also here?

Oh, you really can see him reflected in the mirror! Shiratori, did you also come shopping?
{% endbubble %}


{% img https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/852910018466283553/908942942834667560/IMG_7818.png %}

{% bubble Aira %}
……Ahaha, yes yes~ What a nice coincidence~?

(Huu, I accidentally revealed my position……)

(At times like this, the only thing to do is pretend it’s a coincidence. I don't want them to think I'm a weirdo stalker~!)
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori %}
To summarise, Tori-kun and I are having a cuteness competition right now, the winner will get to buy this shirt, that’s why we hope you’ll go according to your instinct and give your precious vote!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Aira %}
Huh?! Me, how can i have the right to critique the two senpai-s!

In my eyes, the two senpai-s are celestially cute! To let me select gold and silver is not even a matter of choice, it’s an inquiry of the soul!

……But wait a sec. Shiratori, stand still.

(Hm? Hm? Why are the two senpai-s not speaking and only scanning me up and down without blinking?)

It shouldn’t be that they found out I was following them all along?! huu, i want to burrow into a hole……! )

(All because just now I was too entranced by watching the senpai-s, and couldn’t resist coming a bit closer, until I forgot to keep track of my surroundings.)
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori %}
Apologies, this gave you this much stress? Actually this is only a lighthearted battle of wills between me and Hiyori-sama, you don’t need to take it too seriously.
{% endbubble %}
