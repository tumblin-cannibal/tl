{% bubble Tori %}
Hm, even though I'd rather not accept it, I’ll still give this shirt to you, Shiratori.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori %}
Yes yes, Tori-kun and I are on the same wavelength!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Aira %}
Ehh? What is this? I can’t for the life of me catch up with the two senpai-s’ trains of thought~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori %}
To be honest, one look and you can see why. This shirt suits you the best, that’s why Tori-kun and I both willingly withdrew from the competition.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori %}
Yes! Shiratori, it’s hard to come by such fitting clothing, you better not miss out on this opportunity!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Aira %}
That, that…… Thank you so much for your enthusiastic recommendation, but I didn't come here to buy clothes.

Although it’s quite embarrassing to admit, I’ve already spent all that I have, so……
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori %}
So that’s the case. It’s alright, I'll just need to buy it for you, don’t i?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori %}
I see, how sly of Tori-kun to use this opportunity to try to increase your favourability in Aira-kun’s eyes, how sly~

Jun-kun, Jun-kun, hurry and have the shop clerk pick out a size that fits Aira-kun, and wrap it up!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori %}
Sigh~! How can Hiyori-sama snatch away this one too? At least let me carry half of the bill?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori %}
Haha, then let’s do it like that. Well then, Aira-kun, you can’t reject us now♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Aira %}
……Woah?! Is this the power of the rich?! The- Then I'll accept it with gratitude in my heart!

Uwoah, this is a present given by an idol! Once I return home, I'll definitely wash it well and designate it as a family heirloom!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori %}
Haha, isn’t your reaction too exaggerated? And doing so would defeat the purpose of buying it.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori %}
I say I say, Aira-kun, wear it the next time we meet and let us see! Undoubtedly it’ll be super cute!

Oh and I've been really curious since earlier, the bags Aira-kun are holding seems to be stuffed full, what exactly did you buy?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Aira %}
Ehehe, this will remain a temporary secret. Wait for a while and Tomoe-senpai will naturally come to know~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori %}
…………?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Aira %}
I still have some things to do after this, so I'll leave first! To have met the senpai-s, it makes today so so happy!

Oh and I hope that the senpai-s will have a great time at the beach!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori %}
Well then, bye bye~

……Eh, did we tell Shiratori we are going to the beach?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori %}
I don’t think so. Aira-kun is really a child bundled with mystery.
{% endbubble %}

{% narration %}
A few days after
{% endnarration %}

{% bubble Tori %}
Good morning~ I'm 「fine」’s Himemiya Tori. Please take care of me for today’s photoshoot~♪ (Cutely bows and greets)
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori %}
(Hm…… So Tori-kun onset would be this kind of obedient and cute idol, thus swiftly conquering everyone’s hearts.)

So that even if he slips up, he will be forgiven by the doting crew. This child shouldn’t be underestimated.)
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun %}
Ohii-san, what you’re thinking clearly shows on your face.

Sigh…… Even if Ohii-san is only pretending in front of people, if you restrained your capriciousness a bit it would get rid of a lot of my work-related stress.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori %}
Sorry but that’s unacceptable. The fans who’ve liked me since long before, they definitely do accept every part of me, right?

If I suddenly changed a part of me, my charisma would follow, diminishing.

And by Tori-kun’s side there’s the servant-kun who would follow him till death. Why can’t Jun-kun learn from that?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuzuru %}
Were your esteemed selves talking about the young master just now?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori %}
……?!

Even though my heart is not as weak as eichi, it can’t handle repeated shock.

Gosh, it’s not like I’m guilty because I was bad mouthing Tori-kune. I hope that you won’t always appear out of deathly silence.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuzuru %}
Apologies for my rude actions. Eichi-sama has also said that it’s a bad habit of mine, I'll do my best to change it.

Actually, I originally intended to put all my efforts into erasing my presence, and set up an umbrella for the young master at the rest area in advance.

As you can see, today’s sunlight is especially strong. To prevent sunburn during the process of shooting, we must prepare a strict prevention plan.

That’s why, young master please don’t take this opportunity to hide behind hiyori-sama, and obediently let me apply sunblock on your face.
{% endbubble %}

{% img https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/852910018466283553/910379141780635668/IMG_8210.png %}

{% bubble Tori %}
I don't want it! Yuzuru, hand the sunblock over, let me do it by myself!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuzuru %}
…… Young master, why are you suddenly vehemently rejecting it? When we left home in the morning, you were clearly still acquiescent.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori %}
Nnm, that’s because I woke up a bit late, so it would have been faster to let yuzuru help me.

But I dare not want others to think that I’m a helpless child! I’ll definitely be made fun of by the crew members!

And again, it’s only applying sunblock, which is very simple!

First, use a wet towel to wipe clean the sweat and oil on your face, then spray a layer of a mist spray……

After that, squeeze sunblock onto the palm of your hand and use the tip of your finger to spread it evenly across your face, followed by gently dabbing and applying onto your face……

Hmm hmm, how is this? Didn’t I do it well~?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori %}
Ahaha. Even though the steps are correct, tori-kun didn’t apply the sunblock evenly.

Just let me help you? Let me do it, let me do it……☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori %}
——Woah!?

……Hiyori-sama’s fingertips are pretty cold, it feels so nice~

Ehehe. If Hiyori-sama and Eichi-sama are both so kind, I can’t help but want to be spoiled♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori %}
Eh~ Why do you have to suddenly spoil the mood by mentioning Eichi-kun, it’s now totally destroyed.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuzuru %}
……Hiyori-sama, thank you for helping the young master apply sunblock.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori %}
Ahh. Even though Yuzuru-kun has a smile on his face, I have a feeling he’s not happy at all.

Actually you’re probably blaming me for snatching away your job right?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuzuru %}
……

No, I’m blaming myself.

Obviously the young master wanting to be independent is a good thing, but I can never seem to completely let go of his hand, to the point of this inability to adapt leading me to feel disappointed over such changes.



And I remember what happened last year too, once the young master reached the beach he immediately started complaining about how the weather was too hot, the sunrays were too harsh, and made me do this and tha—
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori %}
Hey hey hey, why do you need to bring up my dark past, just because you’re reflecting on yourself!

……My whole life, Yuzuru has already spent so much time tending to me, so I hope yuzuru will think of yourself more from now on.

And for now, after all the trouble coming to the beach, do go together with Hiyori-sama and Jun and rest well.

Ah, the crew members over there are calling me over. I’ll leave Yuzuru in your hands!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori %}
Yes yes, Tori-kun, rest assured and go to work! Jun-kun and I will bring Yuzuru-kun to the nearby beach and guarantee he thoroughly forgets his worries and relaxes!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuzuru %}
……Haha, then I'll humbly accept this precious opportunity. And please, do not drag me along.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun %}
(Ohii-san is sticking his nose in other people’s business again…… but it can’t be helped, he’s this sort of person.)
