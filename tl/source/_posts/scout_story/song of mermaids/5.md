{% bubble Hiyori %}
Always at night a ghost appears, the idol instructor 「Monster」……Does ES really have this sort of ghost stories?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuzuru %}
Yes, it even is considered a popular rumour. Because it happened in Yumenosaki Academy, I heard it’s one of the「Seven Mysteries」.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun %}
「Seven Mysteries」? And what are the others?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuzuru %}
Let me think…… The will-o-wisp loitering about the garden terrace, the Bach portrait whose hair grows longer every time you see it……

But the one that’s most famous should be the piano music that comes from the empty music room?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori %}
Haha, hearing about it is so entertaining! As expected, summer nights are perfect for ghost stories!

Talking about that, Tori-kun tonight is especially quiet. You don’t like the atmosphere?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori %}
……Wuwu (sobbing noises), I completely can’t see how any of these stories are entertaining, it feels like I won’t sleep at all tonight.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori %}
Come come, poor little princess, if you’re scared come I’ll cradle you to my bosom♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori %}
Wh- Who says I’m scared! It must be because the night has a lower temperature so I feel chilly……
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuzuru %}
Then let I go to the lodgings and assist the young master in bringing a jacket, it’ll be a hassle if you really do catch a cold.

Hm? Why are you suddenly grabbing onto the edge of my shirt?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori %}
I’m not actually cold! So don’t go anywhere, and only stay by my side!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuzuru %}
……Haha, as you wish, I understand.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori %}
Talking about that, when I was picking shells in the

{% bubble Jun %}
Mermaids…… That’s a kind of sea creature that only lives in humans’ imagination.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori %}
But at the same time no one can ascertain that mermaids don’t live in this world, right?

Well basically, the tale goes like this——

{% bubble Hiyori %}
「Every full moon night, from the calm quiet sea comes a desolate sob. That is the mermaid’s recounting of its resentment. 」

「Her folk had previously been tricked by the humans on land, eventually becoming sea foam.」
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun %}
Oh, hearing it isn’t that the follow-up of the fairytale「The Little Mermaid」.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori %}
「Those who hear the weeping, if they do not possess a strong will, will get bewitched, and step by step, gravitate towards the ocean, until they get swallowed by the waves 」
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble ??? %}
Wuwu……(crying noises)Wuwuwu……
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori %}
……Hm? Tori-kun, can it be that you’re so frightened that you’re crying?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori %}
How can that be! Bu- But I also seem to have heard it……?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble ??? %}
Wu……Huaahh……
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun %}
There really is someone crying, what’s more it seems to be far away……
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuzuru %}
Ahh. Everyone please raise your heads. Tonight the night sky is clear and one can clearly see a bright and clear full moon.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori %}
Wait a sec, a full moon night…… And an unknown crying voice……
{% endbubble %}

{% img https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/852910018466283553/915200573903618048/IMG_8449.png %}

{% bubble Tori %}
Th- That’s pretty scary! I don’t want to be led into the sea by mermaids?!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuzuru %}
Young master, please calm down a bit. That type of story is usually fiction, but through word of mouth, it became more embellished that’s all.

Above all, you still have me by your side. At any moment, I absolutely won’t let you get a scratch on your body.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori %}
Wait a minute, if indeed this patch of coastal area really has mermaids, then it would surely be frightening! Do you want to follow the sound and find out?

This is a one in a thousand chance, maybe we can even accept interviews as a record holder, and appear on the front page news!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun %}
The headline would be something like 「Shocking news! A famous ES idol found a mermaid when on vacation by the beach, what is its true identity?!」
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori %}
Yes yes, hearing it sounds very sensational, this is good weather/ii hiyori! Then let’s hurry and assemble a search team to explore!
{% endbubble %}

{% img https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/852910018466283553/915200574234963988/IMG_8450.png %}

{% bubble Tori %}
…………
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuzuru %}
Apologies, the young master seems to have fainted till he does not have any reaction.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori %}
Ugh, it’s true. Then, Yuzuru-kun, stay here and accompany Tori-kun, and wait for our good news.

Jun-kun Jun-kun, hurry and come along, Let’s go!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun %}
Right right right……

(To be honest, I don’t really care whether or not mermaids exist.)

(If I had known earlier then I wouldn’t have mocked Ohii-san…… This reaction is like he’s roused his fighting spirit, and he won’t rest till he finds an answer. )
{% endbubble %}

{% img https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/852910018466283553/915200588793393212/IMG_8451.png %}

{% bubble Hiyori %}
Now we’re close to the source of the sobbing, which is also coming closer to the truth of the case in point! Watson, what do you Jun: Hah? Is Ohii-san once again hooked on what random detective stories or dramas?

But that crying person’s shadow looks very small, and of course it doesn’t have any sort of mermaid’s tail…… It’s probably just a small It should be because at night there are many people strolling about the beach, and the child accidentally left their parents behind, that’s why they’re crying non-stop.

Eh, what a horribly boring deduction~? But I agree with you.

Let us keep moving ahead to uncover the mystery together, allowing this story to go full circle and arrive at a happy ending.

Hello, my little friend~ Are you searching for your Papa and Mama?

Don’t fear, don’t fear, this big brother here and I aren’t bad people, we’re in fact coming to help you aren’t we?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun %}
Sorry, but I still have to be the tsukkomi for a bit, what bad person would say they’re a bad person……

Well, Ohii-san, you stay by her here, don’t let her wander around.

Her parents should be searching for her too, so I’ll go and ask the pedestrians walking nearby, we should get good news quickly.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori %}
HmmMmm (sound of agreeing), then leave it to me! How reliable Jun-kun is at times like this!

There there, your papa and mama will be by your side in a flash, so please don’t cry?

See your cute little face is all wrinkled into a knot, let me wipe off your tears with this handkerchief. There there, good kid good kid.

I’m very sorry, I don’t have any snacks or toys onhand, but I can sing a very nice song.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori %}
♪～♪～♪

You ask what song is that? ……I don’t quite remember, maybe I heard it during my childhood.

I’m not sure why, but that tune just appeared in my mind.

……What is it? Do you feel better now?

That’s great♪ I also feel that this song is comforting, it has a kind of healing power.

Look, that big brother from earlier also brought your papa and mama back~ Hurry, go hug them tight and don’t ever let go.

Haha, that smile right now is very good! This is good weather/ii hiyori……♪

{% bubble Hiyori %}
Jun-kun, Jun-kun, I knew you were here playing games again!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun %}
……Hm? If it is the letter you’re holding in your hands, I’m guessing it should be a fan letter. Isn’t this a normal occurrence?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori %}
Mmmmm (sound of agreeing), you guessed half of it! This is not a normal fan letter, but a letter of thanks!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun %}
Letter of thanks……?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori %}
Do you still remember the time we were spending our holiday Afterwards her parents recognised that we were the idols from 「Eve」 that appeared on TV.On top of that, they now regret that they weren’t able to get an autograph!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun %}
So it’s like that. Truth be told, in such a situation, you wouldn’t care about other stuff.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori %}
And and, that child drew a picture for me, together with the letter of thanks!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun %}
What…… is this drawing? A fish that sings? Wearing some green unknown thing on its head?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori %}
Jun-kun’s eyesight is too weak,it’s obviously a beautiful mermaid!

Can’t you see the words written here, even though the strokes are all over the place? Just scrutinise it for a bit and you’ll recognise the characters.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun %}
Mer, maid, prin, cess, your, highness…… Yes, it suits Ohii-san♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori %}
Hmph, logically speaking, shouldn't it be your highness the prince?

It must be because she heard Jun-kun call me 「Ohii-san」, and assumed it to be a homonym of 「Princess」. You’re all to blame!

But then, I fear I’m not like the fairytale’s mermaid princess, turning into seafoam at dawn and disappearing.

Because, I’m not anyone else but the world’s one and only idol—Tomoe Hiyori!

I will always stand on the sparkling stage, and help bring out everyone’s smile and love, to imprint my existence into everyone’s memory!
