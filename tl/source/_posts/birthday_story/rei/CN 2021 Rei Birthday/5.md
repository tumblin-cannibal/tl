Happy birthday, Rei-chin!

This is the gift everyone from Ra*bits prepared for you! it’s a coffin shaped phone stand♪

Lately you learned how to use a smartphone. You've been using it a lot more, right? That's why we thought this gift would suit you, and picked it out.

Kukuku, as expected of the kids Nito-kun leads. Many thanks, I will use it well.

Oooh……this phone stand can also be used when charging, how convenient.

{% bubble Nazuna %}
Hehe. This type of feature was what Tomo-chin and the other kids were in charge of picking out. They said that when it comes to things like this, just looking cute isn't enough; it's gotta be practical…
