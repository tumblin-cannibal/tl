{% bubble Rei %}
Oh, it’s Kaoru-kun. Finally you’ve come, I’ve been waiting for thee.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru %}
You’ll be twenty after today. The age where you can legally drink so what goals do you have after welcoming twenty?

Haha, if you’re asking me i think it’s ok to have that goal. But if Rei-kun wants to think of a new goal, then you could pursue the duties in front of you while pondering over it. If you need my help I can come up with some suggestions.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rei %}
I thank thou, Kaoru-kun. Wait till you’re also twenty then let us go out for drinks.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru %}
Happy birthday, Rei-kun♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rei %}
Hm, let I think for a moment. I believe it’s no longer appropriate to dream of conquering the world, saying that makes it seems like I'm still a child. I would have to think of a more suitable goal……
