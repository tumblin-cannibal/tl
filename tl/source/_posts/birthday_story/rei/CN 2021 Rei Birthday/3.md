Happy birthday, Sakuma-senpai.

Originally Oogami and I bought your gifts together, but in the end I forgot and left one of them in the dorm, so I went back to take it. Did I make senpai wait?

Thou even went and prepared a gift for me, i’m really happy for it. Let I see what you two have picked out for me.

We picked a double use umbrella (parasol), and an insulated mug. And we picked out something that fits your style. We hope you’ll like the gifts.

It’s alright, I don't mind. I had made use of the time waiting by talking with lots of people.

These are gifts you picked just for me, how could I not like them? I give my thanks to you, Adonis-kun. If I have time later, I would also need to thank the puppy too.
