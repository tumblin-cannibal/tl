Hello! I'm uuru/乐恩, I'm an aspiring chinese translator. Bilingual since birth, I'm here to spread some love for chinese literature, especially through enstars and [manhuas](https://tinyurl.com/random-scans) [+](https://tinyurl.com/cadrescans).

I'm currently living in SEAsia so hello SEAsian friends. Also, I tend to enjoy lots of bands especially DIR EN GREY so hit me up for metal music recs.

Here is a list of my current interests that I translate from:
* **Ensemble Stars:** Valkyrie, Eden, Switch
* **Manhuas:** 蜘蛛丝/Spider Silk
* **Manhwas:** [Define the Relationship TLPR](https://mangadex.org/title/e38650ce-464c-4f5b-b199-b5f4327be507/define-the-relationship), [Heat and Love TL](https://www.mangaupdates.com/series.html?id=176051), [The Foul PR](https://mangadex.org/title/557be0fe-c79e-4fa0-8632-5fb8bd4482e4/the-foul)

## On Translations
I try my best to convey the artistic sensibility that Chinese holds and for that to stand, I tend to like so called more flowery speaking styles like Rei and Valkyrie, and are more familiar with the units I listed out. However, if a story interests me I would translate to the best of my ability.

### Personal Style Guide

- British English, Japanese name order
- Honorifics like -senpai and -kun are usually kept like that
- Sound effects like wuwuwu (crying sounds) are kept like that to showcase how it sounds like.

### Guidelines
- You are **not** allowed to repost my translations on other sites without my prior approval.
- Screenshots are okay, as long as it's not the entire story.
- Please share my translations in private DMs, not in a public server.
- You can use my translations in bots specific to a character, group, or ship, as long as credit (by name) is given somewhere. It would be appreciated if you let me know about them too on twitter @/tumblincannibal
- Please let me know if you're going to re-translate my works into other languages.
- You may share this site with others.

## Finale
Please let me know of any mistranslations, and suggestions on what can be improved are also welcome.
